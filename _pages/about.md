Hi, there, my name is Chaoqun Li. Currently I am working in [MediaTek](https://www.mediatek.com/) as an Android Developer based in Beijing, China. My primary responsibilities include developing new features and handling Feature/Module CRs for various chipsets.

Before this, I was a student at [Zhengzhou University](http://english.zzu.edu.cn/). During my second year there, I joined the [Simulation robot laboratory of Zhengzhou University](http://xg.zzu.edu.cn/kytd/1521293776735.jhtml).
A year after joining the lab, I became the FIRA 5VS5 team leader. As our team consisted of only four members, the demarcation of roles wasn't distinct, I both trained freshmen and coded for new strategies.

I started learning computer programming when I was a high school student. I've developed a strong passion for programming over the years. I am proficient with C++ and Java. I use them a lot during my daily work. Additionally, I've gained experience with Python and C through a number of coursework projects. My favorite programming language is C++ which I think is elegant and effective. Despite the occasional challenges I experience with reading and debugging code in this language, I still hold a strong preference for it.

During my downtime, I like playing games and skateboarding, you may find me at Wangjing Park trying to pull off kickflips on a skateboard every weekends. Also I am starting to play Elden Ring recently, still blocking in Ancestor Spirit.
