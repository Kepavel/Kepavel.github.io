Hi there,

My name is Chaoqun Li, and I’m a Ph.D. candidate in the [Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) department](https://www.uta.edu/academics/schools-colleges/engineering/academics/departments/cse) at the University of Texas at Arlington (UTA). My research focuses on Graph Algorithms and Graph Neural Networks (GNN), with a passion for tackling challenges in graph-based systems and computational tasks.

Before starting my Ph.D., I worked as an Android Developer at [MediaTek](https://www.mediatek.com/) from 2020 to 2024, where I developed features and handled Feature/Module Change Requests (CRs) for various chipsets.

I’m always excited to connect with others who share similar research interests, particularly in graph computing, machine learning, and related fields.

In my downtime, I enjoy playing games—currently exploring Baldur’s Gate—and skateboarding for fun.

Feel free to reach out if you’re interested in research discussions or just want to [connect](cxl6029@mavs.uta.edu)!
