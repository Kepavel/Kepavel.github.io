Hi, I'm Chaoqun Li. Currently I am working in [MediaTek](https://www.mediatek.com/) as Android Developer based in Beijing, China. My main job is developing new features and handling Feature/Module CR in some Chips.

Before this, I was a college student in [Zhengzhou University](http://english.zzu.edu.cn/), 
and I joined [Simulation robot laboratory of Zhengzhou University](http://xg.zzu.edu.cn/kytd/1521293776735.jhtml) in the second year of my college.
I became the FIRA 5VS5 team leader in the second year after I joined the lab, mainly responsible for enrollment and training freshman.

I started learning computer programming when I was a high school student. I like programming. I am proficient with C++ and Java. I have used them to take many programming contests. I can also use python and C by doing some course works.

I like listening to music, jogging, and reading science fiction.
